##  BEAST:  A Bayesian Ensemble Algorithm for Change-Point Detection and Time Series Decomposition

<img align="right"  height="500" src="https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast/raw/master/R/Images/beach.png">

####  BEAST (Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend) is a fast, generic Bayesian model averaging algorithm to decompose time series or 1D sequential data into individual components, such as abrupt changes, trends, and periodic/seasonal variations, as described in <ins>[Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019)</ins>. BEAST is useful for changepoint detection (i.e., breakpoints or structural breaks), nonlinear trend analysis, time series decomposition, and time series segmentation
> **BEAST** was impemented in C/C++ but accessible from R and Matlab. Check the `Source`, `R`, and `Matlab` folders at [Github](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast) for the C, R, and Matlab code.

**Quick installation**:
   * In Matlab, run **`eval(webread('http://b.link/beast',weboptions('cert','')))`**  
   * In R,     run **`install.packages("Rbeast")`**
   * Or follow the more detailed instructions below to install and run BEAST

   1. from **CRAN**: An R package **`Rbeast`** has been deposited at [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rbeast). (On CRAN, there is another Bayesian time-series package named "beast", which has nothing to do with the BEAST algorithim. Our package is `Rbeast`.) Install it in R using
      ```R
       install.packages("Rbeast")
      ```

   2. from **GitHub**: The latest versions of R package files are available here at [GitHub](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast). Alternative ways to install **`Rbeast`**  are:

      ```R
        # Windows x86 or x64 (install from binary)
        install.packages("https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast/raw/master/R/Windows/Rbeast_0.9.4.zip" ,repos=NULL)
         
        # Linux/Mac (install from source)
        install.packages("https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast/raw/master/R/Rbeast_0.9.4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
      ```


   #### Run and test Rbeast in R
   
<img align="left"  height="300" src="https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast/raw/master/R/Images/Nile.png">

The main functions in Rbeast are `beast(Y, ...)`, `beast.irreg(Y, ...)`, and `beast123(Y, metadata, prior, mcmc, extra)`. The code snippet below  provides a starting point for the basic usage.  

  ```R
      library(Rbeast)
      data(Nile)                       #  annual streamflow of the Nile River    
      out = beast(Nile, season='none') #  'none': trend-only data without seasonlaity   
      print(out)                   
      plot(out)
      ?Rbeast                          # See more details about the usage of `beast`                 
  ```

## Installation for Matlab  [![View Rbeast on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72515-rbeast)
 

Install the Matlab version of BEAST automatically to a local folder of your choice by running 
  ```Matlab  
  beastPath = 'C:\beast\'                   
  eval( webread('http://b.link/beast') )  
  
  % NOTE -- Write permission needed for your chosen path; the var name must be 'beastPath'
  % If webread has a certificate error, uncomment and run the following line instead:
  % eval(  webread( 'http://b.link/beast', weboptions('cert','') )  );
  ```
The above will download all the files in the [Rbeast\Matlab folder at Github](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast) to the chosen folder: if `beastPath` is missing, a default temporary folder (e.g., `C:\Users\$user_name$\AppData\Local\Temp\Rbeast for Windows 10`) will be used. If the automatic script fails, please download the Matlab files from [Github](https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast) manually. These files include a Matlab mex library compiled from the C soure code (e.g., `Rbeast.mexw64` for Windows, `Rbeast.mexa64` for Linux, `Rbeast.mexmaci64` for MacOS) and some Matlab wrapper functions (e.g.,`beast.m`, and `beast123.m`) similar to the R interface, as well as some test datasets (e.g., Nile.mat, and co2.mat).

#### Usage 
The Matlab API is similar to those of R. Below is a quick example:
  ```Matlab
   help beast
   help beast123  
   load('Nile.mat')                                   % annual streamflow of the Nile River startin from year 1871
   out = beast(Nile, 'season', 'none','start', 1871)  % trend-only data without seasonality
   printbeast(out)
   plotbeast(out)
  ```
We generated the Matlab mex binary library on our own machines with Win10, Ubuntu 22.04, and macOS High Sierra. If they fail on your machine, the mex library can be compiled  from the C source code files under `Rbeast\Source`. If needed, we are happy to work with you to compile for your specific OS or machines. Additional information on compilations from the C source is also given below.

Wrappers in Python and Julia are being developed: We welcome contributions and help from interested developers. If interested, contact Kaiguang Zhao at zhao.1423@osu.edu.

## Description
Interpretation of time series data is affected by model choices. Different models can give different or even contradicting estimates of patterns, trends, and mechanisms for the same dataâ€“a limitation alleviated by the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change,seasonality, and trend (BEAST) of this package. BEAST seeks to improve time series decomposition by forgoing the "single-best-model" concept and embracing all competing models into the inference via a Bayesian model averaging scheme. It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, finance, public health, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data. Details on BEAST are reported in [Zhao et al. (2019)](https://go.osu.edu/beast2019). The paper is available at https://go.osu.edu/beast2019.

## Additional Notes

1. **Computation**

As a Bayesian algorithm, BEAST is fast and is possibly among the fastest implementations of Bayesian time-series analysis algorithms of the same nature. For applications dealing with a few to thousands of time series, the computation won't be an practical concern at all. But for remote sensing applications that may easily involve millions or billions of time series, computation will be a big challenge for Desktop computer users. We suggest first testing BEAST on a single time series or small image chips first to determine whether BEAST is appropriate for your applications and, if yes, estimate how long it may take to process the whole image. In any case, for stacked time-series images, do not use `beast` or `beast.irreg` and use **`beast123`** instead, which can handle 3D data cubes and allow parallel computing.  We also welcome consultation with Kaiguang Zhao (zhao.1423@osu.edu) to give specific suggestions if you see some value of BEAST for your applications.

2. **Compilation from source code**

The BEAST source code appears more complicated than necessary, mainly because the same source is used for both R and Matlab interfaces (also for Python and Julia) as well as for various compilations settings (e.g., compiler variants, alternative library dependencies, cross-platform compatibility, mixed language interfaces, and Win32 API native interfaces). The complication control variables are defined as MACROs in abc_macro.h. Of the soure code files, there are dozens of "abc_xxxx.c" files, which are some auxiliary files; the BEAST algorithm itself is coded in beastv2_COREV4.c; and the R and Matlab interfaces are coded in glue.c and abc_ide_util.c.

We tested our source code under many common compliers (e.g., MSVC, gcc, clang, icc, mingw gcc, and Solaris) and all successfully passed (e.g., see the [Rbeast package status report](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Rbeast.html)). To compile for R, you need to make sure your machine has a C compiler appropriately set up. For example, see [Package Development Prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) for the tools needed for your operating system. In particular, on Windows platforms, the most convenient option is to go with the Rtools toolkit. To compile for Matlab, the appropriate C/C++ header files (e.g., mex.h) have to be correctly specified. Below are some compilation schemes using the gnu compilers as an example.

To compile from the source, first download all the C/C++ files in the Source folder to your local folder, and go to your local folder and make it as the current working directory.

* To create the Matlab library, run the following steps.
     1.  Compile the C/C++ sources into object files and link the object file as a mex lib
     ```C
     gcc -shared -fPIC -pthread -DM_RELEASE -I/MATLAB/extern/include -O2 -Wall -std=gnu99 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mstackrealign -L/MATLAB/bin/glnxa64  -lpthread -lmx -lmex -lmat -lm -lut -lmwservices  *.c -o Rbeast.mexa64
     ```
     > `/MATLAB/extern/include` is the Matlab's path for the include header files such as mex.h. Replace it with the correct one for your machine. On Windows, the path is typically `"C:/Program Files/MATLAB/R2019a/extern/include"`.
     > `/MATLAB/bin/glnxa64` is the Matlab's path for the static/import libraries such as libmex.lib and libmat.lib. Replace it with the correct one for your machine. On Windows, the path is typically `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2019a\extern\lib\win64\microsoft` for the Visual studio compiler and `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2019a\extern\lib\win64\mingw64` for the MinGW gcc compiler. Also, for Windows, the output should be `Rbeast.mexw64`.
     2.  Alternatively, if your Matlab has the mex command correctly set up, the mex library can be compiled from
     ```C
     mex -v CFLAGS='-DM_RELEASE -UUSE_MEX_CMD -fPIC -O2 -Wall -std=gnu99 -march=native' -lmwservices -lut *.c -output Rbeast.mexa64
     ```
     3. Put the resulting Rbeast.mex library together with other m scripts (e.g., beast.m) to call Rbeast via beast or beast123; if needed, Rbeast.mex can be called directly as follows:
     `Rbeast('beastv4',Y,metadata, prior,mcmc, extra)`      
    
* An R dynamic lib (which is the dll/so/dynliab file--part of the R package but not the whole R package itself) probably never needs to be created mannually. But just in case that it is needed, run the following steps.

     1. Compile the C/C++ sources into object files and link them as a shared lib

        ```C
        gcc  -shared  -fPIC -pthread -DR_RELEASE  -I/opt/R-devel/lib/R/include -O2 -Wall -std=gnu99 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mstackrealign  -L/opt/R-devel/lib/R/lib -lpthread -lm -lR *.c -o Rbeast.dll
        ```
        > `/opt/R-devel/lib/R/include` is the R's path for the include header files such as R.h. Replace it with the correct one for your machine. On Windows, the path is typically `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.1.0\include`.
        
        > `/opt/R-devel/lib/R/lib` is the R's path for the static/import libraries such as libR.so. Replace it with the correct one for your machine. On Windows, the path is typically `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.1.0\bin\x64`. On Windows, MinGW compilers should be able to link with the R.dll file directly, but for MSVC, R.dll has to be first exported as an import library to be linked.
        
    2. The R dll library is useful ONLY if you intend to call the dll directly, as shown below.
    ```
      dyn.load("Rbeast.dll");  
      o =.Call('rexFunction',list('beastv4', co2, metadata=metadata,prior,mcmc,extra,1 ),12345 );
      dyn.unload("Rbeast.dll")
    ```
